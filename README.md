# wordsinsubreddit.py
This is a simple little program I wrote to count the words and their occurrences in a 
specified subreddit. It is run as a stand alone command, with not arguments. It asks what subreddit to count, leave out the leading /r/ here as it is added in the code. Next it will ask how many posts to count. While running it will display any new words that are being added to the list. 

PRAW.INI
if you wish to run this you need to set up a api through reddit. and modify the praw.ini file with keys. User info is not mandatory because its not posting anything to reddit.
